DESCRIPTION
       Using either URLs or flat files, this program attempts to validate web
       pages according to their own DTD.

USAGE
       This program can be used in several ways to validate web pages. It will
       take a root URL and crawl the website from the root and validate every
       page it finds below it, it can test named URLs only. Given a root local
       directory it will traverse the directory tree and validate every HTML
       file it finds, it will test a single file or a list of files. In short
       it tries to validate web pages.

       URL Options


       * -r│root url
           Given a root URL will traverse the website, validating all pages
           found that are below the root URL. Thus external links and those
           outside of the root URL are ignored.

       * -u│url url
           Given a single URL will validating the current page only.

       * --ulist file
           The given file should contain a list of URLs (one per line), which
           will then be validated. Note that only the links listed are vali-
           dated, no crawling of the links within the page is performed.

       File Options


       * -p│path path
           Given a root directory will traverse the directory tree and vali-
           date every .html or .htm file it finds.

       * -f│file file
           Validates a single file.

       * -flist file
           The given file should contain a list of files (one per line), which
           will then be validated.

       Supporting Options


       * -i│ignore file
           The given file should contain patterns (one per line) used to
           ignore URLs and files (e.g. user login) from validation.

           By default mailto links and various document and binary file for-
           mats are ignored, together with any none ’http’ protocol.

       Other Options


       * -h│help
           Provides a help screen.

       * -v│version
           Provides the current program version
