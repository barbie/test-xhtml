Test-XHTML
==========

This distribution aims to help web developers keep their web pages valid and
accessible. While by no means complete, the tests that can be performed
should go a long way to help clean HTML code.

Using a list of files or URLs, or even a single site path, this distribution
can be used to point a one or more web pages.

There are three types of tests that can be enabled, DTD Validation, WAI WCAG
v2.0 compliance and basic Best Practices, so you can try and be as complete as
you need to be.
